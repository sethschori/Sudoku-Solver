# Sudoku-Solver
Sudoku Solver solves Sudoku puzzles using two approaches: 1. trial-and-error computer techniques (recursive) and 2. human-style techniques (process of elimination). Please note that approach #2 only solves relatively easy Sudoku puzzles, as it only employs about a third of the techniques that human players use. As far as I know, approach #1 can solve any Sudoku puzzle.
