# Sudoku-Solver
A program for solving Sudoku games using two approaches: 1) human-style techniques and 2) trial-and-error, recursive computer techniques (which are considered cheating by human players). You can try out this program and read more about it on <a href="http://sethschori.com/dev/sudoku-solver">my website</a>.

Please note that approach #1 only solves relatively easy Sudoku puzzles, as it only contains about one-third of the techniques that human players use. As far as I know, approach #2 can solve any Sudoku puzzle.
